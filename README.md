# Go Clacks Overhead

This repo is just intended to show off a few examples of how to hook up an X-Clacks-Overhead header for a Go server.

As a longtime Terry Pratchett fan, I had known about this header but recently started doing more http service work and wanted to see what it would take to add this header. The few places that have examples of how to add them show things like configurations for nginx, apache and the like, but I was struggling to find examples for a Go http server. I may add some other library examples, but pull requests of examples are also welcome.
